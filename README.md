## ‚ú® Features

- ‚ôüÔ∏è **Minimax AI Algorithm**  
  Implements a recursive Minimax strategy to predict and block every possible winning path ‚Äî making the AI unbeatable.

- üí° **Optimal Move Evaluation**  
  Evaluates every potential game state to determine the best move, considering both defense and offense simultaneously.

- üß† **Unbeatable Gameplay**  
  The AI never loses. It‚Äôs designed to win or draw ‚Äî never to be fooled!

- üñºÔ∏è **Graphical Interface with OpenGL**  
  Upgraded from a text-based interface to a graphical version using **OpenGL** for rendering the game board, player symbols, and animations.

- üñ±Ô∏è **Mouse-Based Input**  
  Allow players to click on the board using a mouse instead of typing coordinates, creating a smoother and more intuitive experience.

- üåê **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Used **CMake**, **GLFW**, and **OpenGL** to make the application fully cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

- The game begins with **O**'s turn ‚Äî that‚Äôs you!
- **Left-click** on any empty cell to place your move.
- The AI (X) uses the **Minimax** algorithm to immediately respond.
- The game ends when:
  - A player wins (3 in a row), or
  - The board is full (draw).
- A message will pop up when the game ends, and the board will freeze until you restart.
